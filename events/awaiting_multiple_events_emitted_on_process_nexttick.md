There is an edge case worth noting when using the `events.once()` function
to await multiple events emitted on in the same batch of `process.nextTick()`
operations, or whenever multiple events are emitted synchronously. Specifically,
because the `process.nextTick()` queue is drained before the `Promise` microtask
queue, and because `EventEmitter` emits all events synchronously, it is possible
for `events.once()` to miss an event.

```js
const { EventEmitter, once } = require('events');

const myEE = new EventEmitter();

async function foo() {
  await once(myEE, 'bar');
  console.log('bar');

  // This Promise will never resolve because the 'foo' event will
  // have already been emitted before the Promise is created.
  await once(myEE, 'foo');
  console.log('foo');
}

process.nextTick(() => {
  myEE.emit('bar');
  myEE.emit('foo');
});

foo().then(() => console.log('done'));
```

To catch both events, create each of the Promises *before* awaiting either
of them, then it becomes possible to use `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`,
or `Promise.allSettled()`:

```js
const { EventEmitter, once } = require('events');

const myEE = new EventEmitter();

async function foo() {
  await Promise.all([once(myEE, 'bar'), once(myEE, 'foo')]);
  console.log('foo', 'bar');
}

process.nextTick(() => {
  myEE.emit('bar');
  myEE.emit('foo');
});

foo().then(() => console.log('done'));
```
