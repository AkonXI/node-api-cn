[node-gyp][] is a build system based on Google's [GYP][] tool and comes
bundled with npm. GYP, and therefore node-gyp, requires that Python be
installed.

Historically, node-gyp has been the tool of choice for building native
addons. It has widespread adoption and documentation. However, some
developers have run into limitations in node-gyp.
