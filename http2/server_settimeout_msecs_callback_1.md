* `msecs` {number} **Default:** `120000` (2 minutes)
* `callback` {Function}
* Returns: {Http2SecureServer}

Used to set the timeout value for http2 secure server requests,
and sets a callback function that is called when there is no activity
on the `Http2SecureServer` after `msecs` milliseconds.

The given callback is registered as a listener on the `'timeout'` event.

In case if `callback` is not a function, a new `ERR_INVALID_CALLBACK`
error will be thrown.
