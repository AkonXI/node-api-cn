In a package’s `package.json` file, two fields can define entry points for a
package: [`"main"`][] and [`"exports"`][]. The [`"main"`][] field is supported
in all versions of Node.js, but its capabilities are limited: it only defines
the main entry point of the package.

The [`"exports"`][] field provides an alternative to [`"main"`][] where the
package main entry point can be defined while also encapsulating the package,
**preventing any other entry points besides those defined in [`"exports"`][]**.
This encapsulation allows module authors to define a public interface for
their package.

If both [`"exports"`][] and [`"main"`][] are defined, the [`"exports"`][] field
takes precedence over [`"main"`][]. [`"exports"`][] are not specific to ES
modules or CommonJS; [`"main"`][] is overridden by [`"exports"`][] if it
exists. As such [`"main"`][] cannot be used as a fallback for CommonJS but it
can be used as a fallback for legacy versions of Node.js that do not support the
[`"exports"`][] field.

[Conditional exports][] can be used within [`"exports"`][] to define different
package entry points per environment, including whether the package is
referenced via `require` or via `import`. For more information about supporting
both CommonJS and ES Modules in a single package please consult
[the dual CommonJS/ES module packages section][].

**Warning**: Introducing the [`"exports"`][] field prevents consumers of a
package from using any entry points that are not defined, including the
[`package.json`][] (e.g. `require('your-package/package.json')`. **This will
likely be a breaking change.**

To make the introduction of [`"exports"`][] non-breaking, ensure that every
previously supported entry point is exported. It is best to explicitly specify
entry points so that the package’s public API is well-defined. For example,
a project that previous exported `main`, `lib`,
`feature`, and the `package.json` could use the following `package.exports`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-mod",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./lib/index.js",
    "./lib": "./lib/index.js",
    "./lib/index": "./lib/index.js",
    "./lib/index.js": "./lib/index.js",
    "./feature": "./feature/index.js",
    "./feature/index.js": "./feature/index.js",
    "./package.json": "./package.json"
  }
}
```

Alternatively a project could choose to export entire folders:

```json
{
  "name": "my-mod",
  "exports": {
    ".": "./lib/index.js",
    "./lib": "./lib/index.js",
    "./lib/*": "./lib/*.js",
    "./feature": "./feature/index.js",
    "./feature/*": "./feature/*.js",
    "./package.json": "./package.json"
  }
}
```

As a last resort, package encapsulation can be disabled entirely by creating an
export for the root of the package `"./*": "./*"`. This exposes every file
in the package at the cost of disabling the encapsulation and potential tooling
benefits this provides. As the ES Module loader in Node.js enforces the use of
[the full specifier path][], exporting the root rather than being explicit
about entry is less expressive than either of the prior examples. Not only
is encapsulation lost but module consumers are unable to
`import feature from 'my-mod/feature'` as they need to provide the full
path `import feature from 'my-mod/feature/index.js`.
