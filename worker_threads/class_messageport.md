* 继承自: {EventEmitter}

Instances of the `worker.MessagePort` class represent one end of an
asynchronous, two-way communications channel. It can be used to transfer
structured data, memory regions and other `MessagePort`s between different
[`Worker`][]s.

With the exception of `MessagePort`s being [`EventEmitter`][]s rather
than [`EventTarget`][]s, this implementation matches [browser `MessagePort`][]s.
