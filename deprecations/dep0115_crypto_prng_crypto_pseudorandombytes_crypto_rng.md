Type: Documentation-only (supports [`--pending-deprecation`][])

In recent versions of Node.js, there is no difference between
[`crypto.randomBytes()`][] and `crypto.pseudoRandomBytes()`. The latter is
deprecated along with the undocumented aliases `crypto.prng()` and
`crypto.rng()` in favor of [`crypto.randomBytes()`][] and might be removed in a
future release.
